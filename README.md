# infrastructure-from-scratch

1. Describe what DevOps is to you and how you see it functioning in a software business.
2. Bearing in mind that hiber’s products will likely be a series of mobile and web apps,
supported on the backend by microservices exposing REST web services and built
primarily in Java (Spring) and Scala, propose what platforms and infrastructure you would
run such applications on. Databases include PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB and Apache
Spark, with Apache Kafka in the middle.
3. Outline how you would structure and build the environments, given consideration to
supporting the software developers and their ability to deploy into test, staging and
production environments.
4. Outline the automation and monitoring you would put in place. Explain the different types
of monitoring, and what the automation you would put in place does ie. what purpose
does it serve?
5. Set up an example of the infrastructure and monitoring that you have defined above. This
is a chance to show us how you go about setting up things and what technologies you
like and are proficient at. Briefly explain the set up and how you went about it. Hint.
README files with the process you went through are good; we do not want to see your
special sauce, we just want to see your thinking and processes.
6. Email your answers and access details for your setup to careers@hiber.com. Github is a
good format.
